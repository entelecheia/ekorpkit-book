    "* Linux (x86-64) with Python >= 3.6 \n",
    "* macOS >= 10.13 with Python >= 3.6\n",
    "* Windows 7 or later (x86, x86-64) with Python >= 3.6\n",
    "* Other OS with Python >= 3.6: Compilation from source code required (with c++14 compatible compiler)\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing, you can start tomotopy by just importing.\n",
