    "- Students will be required to complete a term project as part of this course. \n",
    "- At the midterm, you need to submit a proposal for your project. \n",
    "- The proposal includes the data, and you have to perform the exploratory data analysis on this data.\n",
    "- The term project can take the form of either a research paper or a practical implementation. \n",
    "- For the term project, you need to submit a report and a codebase. \n",
    "- The report should be around 10 pages, and it should describe your methodology, results, and discussion. \n",
    "- The project will be graded on correctness, readability, and efficiency."

    "## 🎲 The Whole Game\n",
    "\n",
    "- Harvard Professor David Perkins's book, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719), popularized the idea of \"teaching the whole game.\" \n",
    "- We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game. \n",
    "- Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n",
    "- This course takes this approach to deep learning.\n",
    "- Most courses on deep learning focus only on what the network “is” and how it works. \n",
    "- This course is different: instead of teaching just the network, we show how to use it to solve problems. \n",
    "- We start by teaching a complete, working, very usable deep learning network using simple, expressive tools. Then we show how to use it to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "- This approach has several advantages:\n",
    "  - It makes deep learning more accessible and understandable. Students can see how deep learning can be used in practice, and they can immediately start using it to solve their own problems.\n",
    "  - It helps students learn the whole game of machine learning, not just deep learning. In addition to showing how to use a state-of-the-art deep learning network, we also teach important concepts such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and deployment.\n",
    "  - It gives students a strong foundation for further study. Because the course covers both the theory and practice of deep learning, students will be well prepared for more advanced courses on the subject."
