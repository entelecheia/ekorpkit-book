## Introduction

eKorpkit provides a flexible interface for NLP and ML research pipelines such as extraction, transformation, tokenization, training, and visualization. Its powerful config composition is backed by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/).

## Key features

### Easy Configuration

- You can compose your configuration dynamically, enabling you to easily get the perfect configuration for each research. 
- You can override everything from the command line, which makes experimentation fast, and removes the need to maintain multiple similar configuration files. 
- With a help of the **eKonf** class, it is also easy to compose configurations in a jupyter notebook environment.

### No Boilerplate

- eKorpkit lets you focus on the problem at hand instead of spending time on boilerplate code like command line flags, loading configuration files, logging etc.

### Pluggable Architecture

- eKorpkit has a pluggable architecture, enabling it to combine with your own implementation.

### Sharable and Reproducible

- With eKorpkit, you can easily share your datasets and models.
- Sharing configs along with datasets and models makes every research reproducible.
