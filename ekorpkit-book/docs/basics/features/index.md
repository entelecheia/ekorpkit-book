# Key features

## [Easy Configuration](./easy_config.md)

- You can compose your configuration dynamically, enabling you to easily get the perfect configuration for each research. 
- You can override everything from the command line, which makes experimentation fast, and removes the need to maintain multiple similar configuration files. 
- With a help of the **eKonf** class, it is also easy to compose configurations in a jupyter notebook environment.

## [No Boilerplate](./no_boiler.md)

- eKorpkit lets you focus on the problem at hand instead of spending time on boilerplate code like command line flags, loading configuration files, logging etc.

## [Workflows](./workflows.md)

- A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
- You can divide your research into several unit jobs (tasks), then combine those jobs into one workflow.
- You can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.

## [Sharable and Reproducible](./share.md)

- With eKorpkit, you can easily share your datasets and models.
- Sharing configs along with datasets and models makes every research reproducible.
- You can share each unit jobs or an entire workflow.

## [Pluggable Architecture](./plug.md)

- eKorpkit has a pluggable architecture, enabling it to combine with your own implementation.
