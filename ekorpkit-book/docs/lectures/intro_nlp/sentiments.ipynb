    "## What is sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "- It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.\n",
    "- It applies natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and machine learning to identify and extract subjective information in source materials such as reviews, comments, and news articles.\n",
    "- The goal of sentiment analysis is to know the attitude of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event."

    "## Sentiment analysis types\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the scale of the sentiment analysis, there are three types of sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document-level sentiment analysis**: This is the most common type of sentiment analysis. It is used to determine the overall sentiment of a document.\n",
    "- **Sentence-level sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine the sentiment of a sentence within a document.\n",
    "- **Aspect-level sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine the sentiment of a specific aspect of a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three types of sentiment analysis can be grouped into two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coarse-grained sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine the overall sentiment of a document. It is also known as document-level sentiment analysis.\n",
    "- **Fine-grained sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine the sentiment of a specific aspect of a document. It is also known as aspect-level sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, depending on the number of classes, there are two types of sentiment analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine whether a document is positive or negative.\n",
    "- **Multi-class sentiment analysis**: This type of sentiment analysis is used to determine whether a document is positive, negative or neutral."

    "\n",

    "## Sentiment analysis with NLTK\n",
    "\n",
    "NLTK has a built-in sentiment analysis module called `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`. It uses a lexicon and rule-based approach to assign a sentiment polarity score to a sentence. The sentiment polarity score is a float within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The score is the sum of the valence scores of each word in the sentence, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1.0 and 1.0. Positive values are positive valence, negative value are negative valence.\n",
