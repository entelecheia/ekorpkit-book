# Workflows

- A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs.
- You can divide your research into several unit jobs (tasks), then combine those jobs into one workflow.
- You can have multiple workflows, each of which can perform a different set of tasks.


## Run a job with `ekorpkit-run`

```{code-cell} ipython3
!ekorpkit-run +job=build_corpus name=bok_minutes num_workers=10
```
