    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "- It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.\n",
    "- It applies natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and machine learning to identify and extract subjective information in source materials such as reviews, comments, and news articles.\n",
    "- The goal of sentiment analysis is to know the attitude of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event."
