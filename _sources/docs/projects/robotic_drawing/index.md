# Robotic Drawing

## Introduction

Robotic drawing is the use of robots to create drawings or artworks through a variety of methods, such as using a robot arm with a pen or 3D printing. Procedural drawing is the creation of drawings using a set of rules or procedures encoded in a computer program, which can generate the drawing automatically. Genetic algorithms are optimization algorithms that can be used to generate drawings optimized for certain criteria by generating variations, evaluating them, and selecting the best-performing ones to create new variations. Deep learning is a type of machine learning based on neural networks that can be used in procedural drawing to classify drawings, generate drawings similar to a set of examples, analyze and understand existing drawings, or create generative models that can generate new examples similar to a set of training data.
