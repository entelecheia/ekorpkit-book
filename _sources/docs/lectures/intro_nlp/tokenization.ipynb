    "- **Embedding**: Mapping tokens to vectors.\n",
    "- **Model**: A neural network that takes token vectors as input and outputs predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the first step in the NLP pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization is the process of splitting a string into a list of tokens. \n",
    "- For example, the sentence \"I like to eat apples\" can be tokenized into the list of tokens `[\"I\", \"like\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"apples\"]`. \n",
    "- The tokens can be words, characters, or subwords."

    "\n",
    "- Tokenization is the process of representing a text in smaller units called tokens.\n",
    "- In a very simple case, we can simply map every word in the text to a numerical index.\n",
    "- For example, the sentence \"I like to eat apples\" can be tokenized into the list of tokens:\n",
    "  > `[\"I\", \"like\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"apples\"]`. \n",
    "- Then, each token can be mapped to a unique index, such as:\n",
    "  > `{\"I\": 0, \"like\": 1, \"to\": 2, \"eat\": 3, \"apples\": 4}`.\n",
