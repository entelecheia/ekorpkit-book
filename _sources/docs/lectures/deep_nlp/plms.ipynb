The vector representation is used as the input to the decoder. For example, the vector representation can be used as the input to the decoder to generate a text.\n",
    "- **Encoder-decoder PLMs** (e.g. T5, BART, MASS, etc.) are used to encode the input sequence into a vector representation and decode the vector representation into the output sequence. The encoder's representation conditions the decoder's output. For example, the vector representation can be used as the input to the decoder to generate a text. Tasks such as summarization and translation are examples of encoder-decoder PLMs.\n",
