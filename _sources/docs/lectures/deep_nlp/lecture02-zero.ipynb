Their experiments on three large language models have shown that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning tasks."

    "As *ad-hoc* decoding methods, *top-p* and *top-K* sampling seem to produce more fluent text than traditional *greedy* - and *beam* search on open-ended language generation. Recently, there has been more evidence though that the apparent flaws of *greedy* and *beam* search - mainly generating repetitive word sequences - are caused by the model (especially the way the model is trained), rather than the decoding method, *cf.* [Welleck et al. (2019)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.04319.pdf). Also, as demonstrated in [Welleck et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02492), it looks as *top-K* and *top-p* sampling also suffer from generating repetitive word sequences."
