    "\n",
    "The abstract from the paper is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Most widely-used pre-trained language models operate on sequences of tokens corresponding to word or subword units. Encoding text as a sequence of tokens requires a tokenizer, which is typically created as an independent artifact from the model. Token-free models that instead operate directly on raw text (bytes or characters) have many benefits: they can process text in any language out of the box, they are more robust to noise, and they minimize technical debt by removing complex and error-prone text preprocessing pipelines. Since byte or character sequences are longer than token sequences, past work on token-free models has often introduced new model architectures designed to amortize the cost of operating directly on raw text. In this paper, we show that a standard Transformer architecture can be used with minimal modifications to process byte sequences. We carefully characterize the trade-offs in terms of parameter count, training FLOPs, and inference speed, and show that byte-level models are competitive with their token-level counterparts. We also demonstrate that byte-level models are significantly more robust to noise and perform better on tasks that are sensitive to spelling and pronunciation. As part of our contribution, we release a new set of pre-trained byte-level Transformer models based on the T5 architecture, as well as all code and data used in our experiments."

    "## What Is A Token In Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "- A token is a sequence of characters that is considered as a single entity during processing. \n",
    "- Tokens are usually derived from words, but they can also be derived from subwords, characters, or even bytes.\n",
    "- For example, the sentence \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\" can be tokenized into the following tokens: [\"The\", \"quick\", \"brown\", \"fox\", \"jumps\", \"over\", \"the\", \"lazy\", \"dog\"].\n",
    "- Some words can be tokenized into multiple tokens, for example, \"don't\" can be tokenized into [\"do\", \"n't\"].\n",
    "- At the byte or chracter level, the sentence can be tokenized into the 43 character tokens.\n",
    "- In transformer models, tokens are usually represented as vectors of fixed length, for example, 512-dimensional vectors to limit the cost of computation.\n",
    "- Attention mechanisms are expensive, and the cost of computation increases with the order of $N^2$ where $N$ is the number of tokens in the sequence.\n",
    "- This explains why tokenization is important, it dramatically reduces the number of tokens in a sequence, and thus the cost of computation."

Rather than adding 100 new tokens for the sentinels, we find it sufficient to reuse the final 100 byte IDs.
