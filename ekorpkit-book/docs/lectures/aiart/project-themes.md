# Project Themes - A Brave New World

There are people who have no emotions in a really beautiful and futuristic world.  They don't know what love is, they don't get angry or sad. They don't experience any of the full range of human emotions. It's a bit like living in a fairy tale, but everything is controlled by the government.
