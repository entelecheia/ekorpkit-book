    "- We can use a language model to help us. \n",
    "- A language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. \n",
    "- It assigns a probability to a sentence, based on the words that come before and after it. \n",
    "- For example, the probability of the sentence \"The cute little puppy chases the yellow ball\" is much higher than the probability of the sentence \"The cute little puppy chases the yellow cat\".\n",
    "- N-gram language models are the simplest kind of language model."
