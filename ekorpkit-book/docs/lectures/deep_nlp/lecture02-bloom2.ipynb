    "The [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11916) from University of Tokyo and Google Brain team suggests that LLMs have fundamental zero-shot capabilities in high-level broad cognitive tasks and that these capabilities can be extracted by simple Chain-of-Thought (or CoT) prompting.\n",

    "Another [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11903) by Google Brain team has further investigated the CoT prompting. They noted that by generating a chain-of-thought (or a series of intermediate reasoning steps) LLMs significantly improve their ability to perform complex reasoning. Their experiments on three large language models have shown that chain-of-thought prompting improves performance on a range of arithmetic, common sense, and symbolic reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "One exmaple:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Q: Roger has 5 tennis balls. He buys 2 more cans of tennis balls. Each can has 3 tennis  balls. How many tennis balls does he have now? \n",
    "\n",
    "- A: Roger started with 5 balls. 2 cans of 3 tennis balls each is 6 tennis balls. 5 + 6 = 11. The answer is 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Q: The cafeteria had 23 apples. If they used 20 to make lunch and bought 6 more, how many apples do they have\n",
    "\n",
    "- A: The cafeteria had 23 apples originally. They used 20 to make lunch. So they had 23 - 20 = 3. They bought 6 more apples, so they have 3 + 6 = 9. The answer is 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Chain of thought reasoning allows models to decompose complex problems into intermediate steps that are solved individually. Moreover, the language-based nature of chain of thought makes it applicable to any task that a person could solve via language. We find through empirical experiments that chain of thought prompting can improve performance on various reasoning tasks, and that successful chain of thought reasoning is an emergent property of model scale.\n",
