    "## What is sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentiment analysis is the process of determining whether a piece of writing is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "- It's also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker.\n",
    "- It applies natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and machine learning to identify and extract subjective information in source materials such as reviews, comments, and news articles.\n",
    "- The goal of sentiment analysis is to know the attitude of a speaker or writer with respect to some topic or the overall contextual polarity or emotional reaction to a document, interaction, or event."

    "- Sentiment analysis is a useful tool for businesses to understand the sentiment of their customers towards their brand, product or service. \n",
    "- It can also be used to understand the sentiment of their competitors. \n",
    "- Sentiment analysis can also be used to understand the sentiment of the general public towards certain issues."
