# Easy Configuration

- You can compose your configuration dynamically, enabling you to easily get the perfect configuration for each research. 
- You can override everything from the command line, which makes experimentation fast, and removes the need to maintain multiple similar configuration files. 
- With a help of the **eKonf** class, it is also easy to compose configurations in a jupyter notebook environment.
