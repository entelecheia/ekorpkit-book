    "NLP systems have three main components that help machines understand natural language:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Splitting a string into a list of tokens.\n",
    "- **Embedding**: Mapping tokens to vectors.\n",
    "- **Model**: A neural network that takes token vectors as input and outputs predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tokenization is the first step in the NLP pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization is the process of splitting a string into a list of tokens. \n",
    "- For example, the sentence \"I like to eat apples\" can be tokenized into the list of tokens `[\"I\", \"like\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"apples\"]`. \n",
    "- The tokens can be words, characters, or subwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In deep learning, tokenization is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens, then converting each token into a numerical vector to be used as input to a neural network."

    "## What is Tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization is the process of representing a text in smaller units called tokens.\n",
    "- In a very simple case, we can simply map every word in the text to a numerical index.\n",
    "- For example, the sentence \"I like to eat apples\" can be tokenized into the list of tokens:\n",
    "  > `[\"I\", \"like\", \"to\", \"eat\", \"apples\"]`. \n",
    "- Then, each token can be mapped to a unique index, such as:\n",
    "  > `{\"I\": 0, \"like\": 1, \"to\": 2, \"eat\": 3, \"apples\": 4}`.\n",
    "- There are more linguistic features to consider when tokenizing a text, such as punctuation, capitalization, and so on."

    "## Why do we need tokenization?\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"How can we make a machine read a sentence?\"\n",
    "- Machines donâ€™t know any language, nor do they understand sounds or phonetics.\n",
    "- They need to be taught from scratch.\n",
    "- The first step is to break down the sentence into smaller units that the machine can process.\n",
    "- Tokenization determines how the input is represented to the model.\n",
    "- This decision has a huge impact on the performance of the model."
