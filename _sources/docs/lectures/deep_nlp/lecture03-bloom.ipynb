    "BLOOM is a causal model language, which means that it was trained as a next-token predictor. This apparently simple strategy of predicting the next token in a sentence, based on a set of preceding tokens, has shown to capture certain degree of reasoning abilities for large language models (arXiv:2205.11916). This enables BLOOM and similar models to connect multiple concepts in a sentence and manage to solve non-trivial problems such as arithmetic, translation, and programming with fair accuracy. BLOOM uses a Transformer architecture composed of an input embeddings layer, 70 Transformer blocks, and an output language-modeling layer, as shown in the figure below. Each Transformer block has a self-attention layer and a multi-layer perceptron layer, with input and post-attention layer norms."

Similarly, the word embeddings and output language-modeling layer can be loaded on-demand from disk.\n",
